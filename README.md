Predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension

## Overview

In the year 2912, the Spaceship Titanic set out on its maiden voyage, carrying nearly 13,000 passengers to habitable exoplanets. Tragically, the ship encountered a spacetime anomaly and many passengers were lost to an alternate dimension. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly, using the records recovered from the damaged computer system.

This challenge is part of a competition that runs indefinitely on Kaggle, featuring a rolling leaderboard to keep the competition fresh and engaging.

## Description
