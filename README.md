### **Spaceship Titanic: Lost in Space? 🚀**

What if the Titanic was a spaceship that collided with a spacetime anomaly? In this project, we're tackling a futuristic version of the classic Titanic survival problem. Our mission is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the collision.

#### **Our Cosmic Journey 🌌**

1.  **Data Exploration 🔭:** We started by exploring the dataset to get to know our intergalactic passengers. We looked at features like their home planet, age, and whether they were in cryosleep.

2.  **Data Cleanup 🧹:** The data had some missing values and categorical features that needed to be handled. We imputed missing values and used one-hot encoding to get the data ready for our models.

3.  **Model Building 🤖:** We built and trained several machine learning models to see which one could best predict a passenger's fate:
    *   **Logistic Regression**
    *   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
    *   **Random Forest**
    *   **Deep Learning (with PyTorch)**

#### **The Verdict 🏆**

After training and evaluating our models, the **Deep Learning model** emerged as the winner with an accuracy of **82.46%**. This shows that even in the vastness of space, neural networks can find the patterns that determine a passenger's destiny.

#### **Tech We Used 🛠️**

*   Python
*   Pandas & NumPy
*   Scikit-learn
*   PyTorch
*   Jupyter Notebook
